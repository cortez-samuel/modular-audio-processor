  -- researched the rp2040 PIO and familiarized with pico-sdk PIO examples.
  -- -- basically just assembly with very little algebraic functionality, still good
        for communication though. Need to be careful about PIO configuration and initialization.
  -- researched I2S transmission
  -- made plan for I2S transmission .pio file
  -- -- called I2S_naive because has no safety to ensure correct channel data.
        need to figure out better way, but making this to be an option.
