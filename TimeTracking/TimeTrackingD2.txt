  -- researched the rp2040 PIO and familiarized with pico-sdk PIO examples.
  -- -- basically just assembly with very little algebraic functionality, still good
        for communication though. Need to be careful about PIO configuration and initialization.
  -- researched I2S transmission
  -- made plan for I2S transmission .pio file
  -- -- called I2S_naive because has no safety to ensure correct channel data.
        need to figure out better way, but making this to be an option.
  -- -- implemented I2S_naive and made I2S_test file for testing transmission with oscilloscope. 
  -- made plan for another I2S transfer, with security so data stays on correct channel
  -- -- data limited to 16 bits per channel max, trying to figure out one which allows for <= 32

  -- Implemented prior plan and got working 
  -- May need to make a class for I2S initialization and reading/writing to make usage 
     simpler and easier to debug

  -- Made filenames more accurate
  -- Designed plan for I2S read that should be able to work for the continuous sampling / sending 
     of data in the I2S format
  -- -- May break if not read from often enough

Noah McGlothlin :: 1/20/2026 11:30am - 2:30pm
  -- Implemented I2S_naive read plan 
  -- -- Requires the input pins (bclk, sd, ws) in sequential order (ie not 1 3 20)
  -- -- Does not ensure data is synched outside of setup phase, 
        but should be fine with continuous input signlas, which is natural with I2S
  -- -- -- Errors have been recreated with reseting I2S_Tx machine, but reseting I2S_Rx 
           machine fixes it

Noah McGlothlin :: 1/22/2026 1:30pm - 6:30pm -- 1/24/2026 12:00pm - 4:30pm
  -- implemented SPI on PIO. Includes a regular SPI .pio file and a SPI .pio file 
     specialized for sending bytes.
  -- -- still need to test both
  -- Tested SPI_byte (the byte-specialized one) and Tx works for the most part (CS signal 
     can end a bit early, about a clock edge but should be fine) Rx does not work, need to debug
  -- -- Ended up being a wiring problem, forgot to change the connections between 
        the master SCLK, MOSI, MISO, and CS pins and the slave ones. Maybe should make SPI_PIO class 
        (or something), to help prevent this from happening, and add consecutive-pin checks 
        to SPI_Byte_Master_init too, to make sure connectiong can be one-to-one.

  -- I2S PIO implementation in a main file
  -- Using the display conflicts with the I2S, need to figure that out
  -- Because of that, currently just the I2S is in main_master, which works fine.

  -- Tried to fix I2S communication
  -- Studied the C++ implementation of the I2S Arduino Library to continue our porting process
  -- Unsuccessful, there still appears to be a bug in which the transmission from one module to another is heavily delayed.
  -- Additionally, the waveform on the receiving module partially resembles the waveform in the transmitting module, being cut off at times.
  -- Fixed issue related to FFT mode being overly sensitive to noise

  -- Got I2S_Tx DMA working
    -- Likely can write to the I2S_Tx buffer too fast for the PIO to go through, but should not cause major 
      problems as the old information will be written over. May cause issues if it overwrights data currently 
      being read at by DMA, have not been able to test but can be avoided with a large enough buffer.
  -- Got I2S_Rx DMA working
    -- Makes use of IRQ to deal with the FIFO (queue) nature of it. 
    -- Had some weird bug where it would sometimes read/store/output (not sure which) a value 6 times instead of 5, 
       thinking it has to do with queuing it a transmission on the Tx side though, rather than a problem with the 
       Rx.
    -- May use IRQ for I2S_Tx instead of control DMA since currently queuing doesn't *actually* queue it in a 
       normal sense, rather Tx will just output the most recent thing queued that cycle. May also be able to 
       make use of transmission count controlling, but would end up being unclear about how it works.
  -- Thinking about using DMA for ADC rather than an IRQ.
