  -- More research on CRC, Checksums, and Hamming code. Made flowchart + pseudocode for CRC(N,d) and 
     wrote Checksum programs and prepared a Safe Communication header for possible use 
     (need to check how SPI is working to make it better)

  -- Got Checksum program to work in wokwi. Wrote CRC8 programs that also work in wokwi (Took a 
     while because C/CPP act kinda weird in it). Will build small wokwi project with 
     SPI initialization, reading/writing to show both work.

  -- Reviewed EEL4744C labs on serial communication
  -- Watched videos and read discussion forums about serial communication for audio data

  -- Continued working on pre-alpha build
  -- Implemented some basic components (audio signal generator, adjust filter coefficient knob, save filter setting button, and fixed some
     issues
     with the OLED display logic).
  -- Continued working on the inter-module SPI communication system. Was unable to get the system to work. Currently, the Wokwi simulation lags
     a lot due to blocking.

  -- Research methods for storing data persistently
  -- Pi Pico does not have EEPROM so will have to emulate with flash memory
  -- Total Time toward Pre-Alpha: 3 Hrs

Logan Dukes :: 10/26/2025 4:00 pm - 8:15 pm
  -- Worked on writing code for using flash as emulated EEPROM to be able to have states
     persist across restarts
  -- In wokwi cannot use the flash for this purpose so had to redo code and instead implement
     this persistent memory as pure code for now. This will be updated to use the flash
     when actual hardware is used
  -- Total Time toward Pre-Alpha: 7.25 Hrs

Samuel Cortez :: 10/26/2025 5:15 pm - 8:47 pm
  -- Continued working on the SPI communication system
  -- Since blocking issue creates a lot of lag in Wokwi, I just focused on implementing the SPI transmission
  -- Added the logic analyzer component to prove serial clock, chip select, and data transmission worked per SPI protocol
  -- Total time toward Pre-Alpha: 12.4 hrs

  Eric Reichard :: 10/26/2025 5:40 pm - 9:40 pm
  -- reading sh1107 datasheet, researching i2c and spi for display
  -- tried hand at making SPI display drivers for later use
  -- wokwi oled fix
  -- Total time towards Pre-Alpha: 9.5 Hrs

William Osborne :: 10/26/2025 17:05 - 22:05
  -- Researched discrete-time continuous passive filters
     -- only implemented low-pass and high-pass, though
  -- Adding filter swapping between the two implemented ones
     -- created in a general manner to allow more filters later on
  -- Connecting the persistent state to the filter swapping
  -- Total time towards pre-alpha: 5 hrs
