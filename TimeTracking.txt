  -- Got Checksum program to work in wokwi. Wrote CRC8 programs that also work in wokwi (Took a 
     while because C/CPP act kinda weird in it). Will build small wokwi project with 
     SPI initialization, reading/writing to show both work.

  -- Implemented some basic components (audio signal generator, adjust filter coefficient knob, save filter setting button, and fixed some
     issues
     with the OLED display logic).
  -- Continued working on the inter-module SPI communication system. Was unable to get the system to work. Currently, the Wokwi simulation lags
     a lot due to blocking.

  -- Research methods for storing data persistently
  -- Pi Pico does not have EEPROM so will have to emulate with flash memory
  -- Total Time toward Pre-Alpha: 3 Hrs

Logan Dukes :: 10/26/2025 4:00 pm - 8:15 pm
  -- Worked on writing code for using flash as emulated EEPROM to be able to have states
     persist across restarts
  -- In wokwi cannot use the flash for this purpose so had to redo code and instead implement
     this persistent memory as pure code for now. This will be updated to use the flash
     when actual hardware is used

Samuel Cortez :: 10/26/2025 5:15 pm - 8:47 pm
