  -- More research on CRC, Checksums, and Hamming code. Made flowchart + pseudocode for CRC(N,d) and 
     wrote Checksum programs and prepared a Safe Communication header for possible use 
     (need to check how SPI is working to make it better)

  -- Got Checksum program to work in wokwi. Wrote CRC8 programs that also work in wokwi (Took a 
     while because C/CPP act kinda weird in it). Will build small wokwi project with 
     SPI initialization, reading/writing to show both work.
